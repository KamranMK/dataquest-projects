# Analyzing CIA Factbook data
The goal of this project is to analyze the CIA Factbook Data using sqlite and Python. In this project, we'll work with data from the [CIA World Factbook](https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/), a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information.
